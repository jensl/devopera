Opera 53 (based on Chromium 66) for [Mac, Windows, Linux](https://www.opera.com/computer) is out! To
find out what’s new for users, see our
[Desktop blog post](https://blogs.opera.com/desktop/2018/05/opera-53-XXX).
Here’s what it means for web developers.


## New ImageBitmap rendering context for <canvas>

The new rendering context allows for more efficient rendering of an image to a
canvas. Instead of creating an `<img>` element and rendering it to the canvas,
which causes multiple copies of the image to be stored in memory, an
`ImageBitmap` object can now be displayed in the canvas directly, effectively by
transferring ownership of the pixel data to the canvas element.

    const image = await createImageBitmap(imageBlob);
    const canvas = document.createElement('canvas');
    const context = canvas.getContext('bitmaprenderer');
    context.transferFromImageBitmap(image);

Since the source image can be fetched and decoded asynchronously, this can be
used in e.g. a WebGL game to load textures on the fly, without jank.


## CSS Typed Object Model

The [CSS Typed Object Model](https://drafts.css-houdini.org/css-typed-om/)
exposes the values of CSS properties to scripts as typed JavaScript objects,
instead of as CSS formatted strings. This makes it more straight-forward to
write code that reads and manipulates CSS properties, and the code will
typically execute faster.

Opera 53 implements the object model for a [subset of CSS properties](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/third_party/blink/renderer/core/css/cssom/README.md).


## Asynchronous clipboard API

A new asynchronous clipboard API has been added that is simpler to use than the
old `document.execCommand("copy")` API, and that integrates with the
[Permissions API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Permissions_API).

With this new API, copying some text to the clipboard is as simple as

    try {
        await navigator.clipboard.writeText("some text");
    } catch {
        console.error("Could not copy text to the clipboard!");
    }

and reading text from the clipboard is equally easy:

    const text = await navigator.clipboard.readText();
    console.log("Clipboard text:", text);

For more information about the new API and how to use it, see [Unblocking
Clipboard Access](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/03/clipboardapi).


## AudioWorklet

The [`AudioWorklet`](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/12/audio-worklet)
API provides a synchronous JavaScript execution context that allows developers
to programmatically control audio output with lower latency and higher stability
than the legacy `ScriptProcessorNode` API, which will be deprecated eventually.

Demos and other `AudioWorklet` resources can be found at [Google Chrome
Labs](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/web-audio-samples/audio-worklet/).


## Other web platform features in this release

### Blink > Animation

* To maintain compatibility with other implementations, the `add` and
  `accumulate` keywords will not throw errors. They will soon be supported by
  Opera.

### Blink > CSS

* The expressions `calc()`, `min()` and `max()` are now supported in media
  queries.
* The `rgb()` and `rgba()` functions now allow floating point values.

### Blink > Feature Policy

* The `deviceorientation`, `deviceorientationabsolute` and `devicemotion` events
  are now by default restricted to top-level documents and same-origin frames,
  as if the [feature policy](https://github.com/WICG/feature-policy/blob/gh-pages/features.md)
  for those features was set to `self`.

### Blink > Fetch API

* The `Request` object now supports the [keepalive flag](https://www.chromestatus.com/features/5760375567941632),
  which can be set when constructing the object, and which allows a fetch to
  continue after the tab is closed.
* The new [`AbortSignal`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortSignal)
  and [`AbortController`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortController)
  makes it possible to cancel fetches.

        const controller = new AbortController();
        const { signal } = controller

        // Start a fetch controlled by the above controller.
        fetch(url, { signal }).then(...);

        // Abort the fetch.
        controller.abort();

### Blink > File API

* Attempting to read from an invalid or non-existing Blob URL now results in a
  network error instead of a 404 error.

### Blink > Forms

* The `<textarea>` and `<select>` elements now support the `autocomplete`
  attribute.
* Toggling a mutable checkbox now triggers a sequence of three events: `click`,
  `input` and `change`, in that order. Previously, the `input` event was not
  fired.

### Blink > Fullscreen

* If a page in fullscreen mode uses `window.focus()` to switch focus to another
  page, fullscreen mode is exited.

### Blink > GetUserMedia

* The new [`MediaStreamTrack.getCapabilities()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStreamTrack/getCapabilities)
  returns a `MediaTrackCapabilities` object with details about the browser's
  capabilities.

### Blink > JavaScript

* The [`Function.prototype.toString()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/toString)
  function now returns the function's source code exactly as it was written,
  including white-space and comments.
* JSON is now a [syntactic subset of ECMAScript](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-json-superset),
  which allows line separator (U+2028) and paragraph separator (U+2029)
  characters in string literals.
* A `try`/`catch` statement can now [omit the binding parameter](https://tc39.github.io/proposal-optional-catch-binding/).
  In other words, if the actual exception is not interesting, the short form
  `try { ... } catch { ... }` can be used.
* `String.prototype.trimStart()` and `String.prototype.trimEnd()` are now
  supported for trimming leading and trailing white-space characters from
  strings, complementing the existing `String.prototype.trim()`. The
  non-standard `trimLeft()`/`trimRight()` functions remain as aliases for
  backwards compatibility.
* `Array.prototype.values()` is now supported. It returns an iterator over the
  values at each index in the array.

### Blink > Layout

*   The `grid-` prefix has been removed from the CSS gutter properties `grid-gap`,
    `grid-row-gap` and `grid-column-gap`, whose names now become just `gap`,
    `row-gap` and `column-gap`.

    The default value is `normal` for all three. The old names remain as aliases
    for the new names. The property `column-gap` already existed as part of CSS
    Multi-column Layout.
*   Elements with a transform property and with the `display` property set to
    `table-row`, `table-row-group`, `table-header-group`, `table-footer-group`,
    `table-cell` or `table-caption`, are now containing blocks for fixed
    position elements.

### Blink > Media

* `autoplay` is now [only allowed](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/09/autoplay-policy-changes)
  when certain conditions are met:

    * the media will not play sound,
    * after the user interacts with the site, or
    * (on desktop) if the user has previously shown an interest in media on the
      site.

### Blink > ServiceWorker

* A service worker can no longer respond to a request whose mode is
  `same-origin` with a response whose type is `CORS`. This is a security measure
  recently added to the Fetch specification.
* `FetchEvent.clientId` returns an empty string instead of `null` when it isn't
  set, which can be the case for instance during a navigation request.

### Blink > WebRTC

* The `RTCRtpSender` object now supports the [`dtmf`](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=812587)
  attribute, replacing the `RTCPeerConnection.createDTMFSender()` function,
  which will be deprecated eventually.

## Deprecations and Interoperability improvements

### Blink > CSS

*   The `object-position` and `perspective-origin` properties no longer accept
    three-part values such as `top right 20%`. Valid position values must have 1,
    2 or 4 parts.

    This also applies to basic shapes and gradients.

### Blink > HTML

* `ImageCapture.prototype.setOptions()` has been removed following a change in
  [the specification](https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-image/#imagecaptureapi).

### Blink > Input

* `Document.prototype.createTouch()` and `Document.prototype.createTouchList()`
  have been removed following changes in [the specification](https://w3c.github.io/touch-events/#extensions-to-the-document-interface).

### Blink > Web Audio

* Automatic dezippering of `AudioParam.prototype.value` changes has been removed
  following a change in the specification. To smooth the value of `AudioParam`
  changes, use `AudioParam.prototype.setTargetAtTime()`.
